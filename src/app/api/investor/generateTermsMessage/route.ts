CONTEXT:
The user just finished a conversation with David Ahn, a startup founder, about investing in his company. Based on the conversation and outcome, you need to write a brief transitional message that:
1. Acknowledges what happened in the conversation
2. Sets up the context for the final chat message from David
3. Reflects the user's emotional state

CONVERSATION TRANSCRIPT:
${conversationText}

NEGOTIATION OUTCOME:
- Deal Reached: ${negotiationState.dealReached ? 'Yes - They agreed on terms' : 'No - User walked away or couldn\'t align'}
- User Asked: ${negotiationState.userAskAmount ? `$${negotiationState.userAskAmount.toLocaleString()}` : 'Not specified'}
- David Offered: ${negotiationState.davidOfferAmount ? `$${negotiationState.davidOfferAmount.toLocaleString()}` : 'Not specified'}
- Deal Closed: ${negotiationState.dealClosed ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
- User Sentiment: ${negotiationState.userSentiment || 'neutral'}

YOUR TASK:
Write a 2-3 sentence message that serves as a transition between the negotiation and David's final message. The tone should be:
- DEAL REACHED: Positive and forward-looking, mentioning the agreement and that David will share final terms
- NO DEAL: Understanding and respectful, acknowledging the conversation ended without alignment but maintaining the relationship
- SENTIMENT: Naturally incorporate the user's emotional state into the narrative

STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Write in third person/omniscient narrator voice
- Be concise (2-3 sentences max)
- Natural storytelling tone
- No melodrama or over-the-top language
- Focus on what's happening next
- Subtly reflect the user's emotional sentiment when relevant

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 (Deal Reached, Happy):
"The numbers finally clicked. After a few rounds of quick messages, you and David landed on terms that work. You're feeling good about the deal. He's typing up the final details now."

Example 2 (No Deal, Frustrated):
"You've decided to pass on this one, especially because you didn't feel like David valued your help these fast few months. There's some frustration there, but you're moving on. He's sending over a final note..."

Example 3 (Deal Reached, Satisfied):
"That last counter-offer did it. You and David found your sweet spot, and the deal's on. You're satisfied with how it shook out. He's pulling together the terms to send your way."

Example 4 (No Deal, Disappointed):
"Despite the back-and-forth, you and David couldn't bridge the gap this time. It's disappointing, but you're feeling OK about walking away. He wants to share a quick closing thought."

Example 5 (No Deal, Relieved):
"You couldn't quite align on the numbers, but honestly? You're relieved to have walked away from a deal that didn't feel right. The pressure's off. David's about to send his final thoughts."

Example 6 (Deal Reached, Excited):
"The deal's done! You and David finally clicked after some back-and-forth. You're excited to be in. He's getting the final terms ready to send over."
