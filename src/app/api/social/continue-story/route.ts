# Turn ${turnNumber} Guidelines
${getTurnGuidelines(turnNumber)}

# Your Task
Continue the story naturally, showing realistic social reactions and consequences. Keep the narrative flowing smoothly - don't explain what the user did, just continue the conversation and scenario naturally.

# Storytelling Requirements
- Write in second person ("you")
- Keep it realistic and relatable - this is normal small talk interaction
- Show natural human reactions to the user's response
- Create smooth narrative flow that builds on what happened
- End with a natural moment that leads to the next interaction
- Break into 2-3 short paragraphs with blank lines between for readability

CRITICAL FORMATTING: Break your response into short paragraphs separated by blank lines. Each paragraph should be 1-2 sentences max for easy reading.

Return ONLY the story continuation with proper paragraph breaks - no explanations.`
