# Conversation Context So Far
${conversationContext}

# What Just Happened
The user's phone buzzed with a text from a friend asking "Mind grabbing coffee after your appointment?"

User chose: "${choice}"

# Your Task
Generate the return-to-conversation narrative that gives the user clear context to continue the social interaction.

${choice === 'check' ? `
Since they checked their phone:
- Show them glancing at the message briefly then putting phone away and looking back up
- What did the other person do/say while user was briefly distracted?
- Give the other person something specific to say or ask that creates natural conversation flow
- Show realistic social dynamics - other person noticed but is being polite about it

` : `
Since they kept listening:
- Show them resisting the phone notification 
- What did the other person finish saying?
- Maybe they noticed the phone light up but appreciate the continued attention
- Continue the conversation thread they were on before the interruption

`}

# Critical Requirements
- Give the user SPECIFIC conversation content to respond to
- Include what the other person says or asks
- Make it feel natural and realistic
- Break into 2-3 short paragraphs with blank lines between for readability
- Don't just say "they're waiting" - give actual conversational hooks

CRITICAL FORMATTING: Break your response into short paragraphs separated by blank lines. Each paragraph should be 1-2 sentences max for easy reading.

Return ONLY the return narrative with proper paragraph breaks - no explanations.`
