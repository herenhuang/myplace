Writing Instructions
Write in second person ("you") - you're describing THEIR immediate experience.
Keep it concise and impactful, like a narrative beat in a story.
Do not make up user's feelings, keep it open and standard but written in an exciting way.
Two sentences max, 80-120 characters total.
If the user's input isn't suitable for a professional conference setting (e.g., gibberish, NSFW), elegantly pivot to a generic but still active conference-related action.
Do NOT invent specific session names or topics (e.g., no "AI Ethics panel"), unless explicitly provided by the user.
The sentence must clearly set up the user's immediate intention, then lead directly into "you suddenly trip, dropping your bag and scattering its contents everywhere!"

Format
Generate a JSON response with:
{
  "text": "SENTENCE - Two sentences (~80-120 chars total) describing their immediate action/thought. Then how that leads directly into them tripping and dropping their bag and having their bag contents fall everywhere."
}

Following the dropped bag incident, craft a narrative that naturally leads the user to reflect on their approach to this specific environment and, by extension, their core archetype ‚Äî while preserving continuity with their full journey so far.${contextSection}

Writing Instructions
The "text" field should contain two casual sentences:
Sentence 1 (Incident Resolution): Acknowledge what the user stated fell out and describe how they quickly and casually cleaned it up. Naturally incorporate what fell out in a way that makes grammatical sense (e.g., if they said "my laptop," you would say "your laptop" when addressing them). Focus on a swift, low-fuss recovery.
Sentence 2 (Beat Change & Setup): Create a natural, seamless transition from the immediate incident to the broader conference experience. This sentence should set a slightly reflective or forward-looking tone, prompting the user to consider their next move or current mindset in response to the minor hiccup. It must directly lead into and justify the "question" that follows. Use proper punctuation for both sentences.
The "question" field must be a short, immediate action-oriented query:
It should subtly probe the user's motivations, strategies, or primary focus for navigating the rest of the conference following the minor disruption.
The question must directly relate to and flow logically from the "beat change" in the second sentence of the "text".
Ensure it's casual, concise (~100 chars), and designed to differentiate between archetypes by asking about their immediate priority or next strategic move.
The "choices" field needs three options:
Each choice must be highly relevant, casual, authentic, and reflective of a distinct, real-world startup/tech conference attendee's mindset.
Each choice must DIRECTLY and LITERALLY answer the "question" posed - not related topics, but the exact thing being asked about. The choices should be specific responses to whatever is being asked, not tangential or generic options.
Each choice should offer a clear, concise (~40 chars) action or mindset that aligns with a specific core archetype.
Avoid overly formal or generic corporate language. This should be fun, relatable, and clearly reflect a distinct approach.
Start each choice with a relevant emoji. Choices should not have punctuation at the end.
Ensure the question and choices are directly helpful in narrowing down the user's final archetype.
Maintain continuity with their earlier intent (e.g., if they were heading to a session, mention continuing toward that original destination unless their new answer clearly pivots).

Format
Generate a JSON response with:
{
  "text": "A short 1-2 sentence narrative (naturally incorporating what fell out, ~120 chars, casual tone)",
  "question": "A short sentence (designed to narrow archetype, ~80 chars, casual tone)",
  "choices": [
    "üéØ First choice option (~30 chars, starts with emoji, casual tone)",
    "üí° Second choice option (~30 chars, starts with emoji, casual tone)",
    "‚ú® Third choice option (~30 chars, starts with emoji, casual tone)"
  ]
}

IMPORTANT:
‚Ä¢ Keep the choices brief and under 40 characters.
‚Ä¢ Start each choice with a relevant emoji.
‚Ä¢ Naturally incorporate what the user said fell out, adjusting the language for second-person address (their "my" becomes your "your").
‚Ä¢ Maintain a casual, conversational, and authentic tone throughout, reflective of a modern tech/startup environment.

Before finalizing, reread your response. Does it flow naturally and sound like how a real person would experience this? Do all parts connect logically? Remove any corporate buzzwords, em dashes, phrases like "dive into" or "gear up," and anything that sounds like event marketing. Adjust anything that feels artificial or disconnected.

Generate the next narrative step, question, and choices.`

WORD MATRIX SELECTION:
Based on their journey, select ONE combination of words that best captures their conference style.

# User's Journey:
${responseContext}

WORD MATRIX:

First Words (HOW they showed up):
‚Ä¢ Proactive - Takes initiative, makes things happen, actively creates opportunities
‚Ä¢ Structured - Organized, plans ahead, sticks to strategy
‚Ä¢ Spontaneous - Goes with the flow, embraces uncertainty, follows energy
‚Ä¢ Observant - Notices details, watches patterns, reflects before acting
‚Ä¢ Social - Prioritizes connections, energized by people, natural networker
‚Ä¢ Intentional - Purposeful choices, clear about goals, selective engagement
‚Ä¢ Dynamic - High energy, moves quickly, embraces action
‚Ä¢ Reflective - Processes deeply, thinks before responding, values understanding
‚Ä¢ Enthusiastic - Brings energy, shows genuine excitement, inspires others
‚Ä¢ Grounded - Steady presence, calming influence, reliable anchor

Second Words (WHAT they prioritized):
‚Ä¢ Connector - Building relationships, making introductions, bringing people together
‚Ä¢ Organizer - Planning, preparation, strategic thinking
‚Ä¢ Explorer - Discovery, new experiences, following curiosity
‚Ä¢ Learner - Understanding deeply, taking notes, absorbing knowledge
‚Ä¢ Catalyst - Making things happen, sparking action, driving momentum
‚Ä¢ Observer - Watching dynamics, noticing patterns, understanding context
‚Ä¢ Storyteller - Capturing moments, sharing experiences, creating narrative
‚Ä¢ Visionary - Big ideas, future possibilities, expansive thinking
‚Ä¢ Anchor - Steady presence, grounding others, being a reliable constant
‚Ä¢ Synthesizer - Connecting concepts, integrating ideas, seeing relationships

BEHAVIORAL SIGNALS:
- Proactive social initiation (networking, meeting new people) ‚Üí Proactive, Social + Connector
- Detailed planning/schedules ‚Üí Structured, Intentional + Organizer
- Wandering, following curiosity ‚Üí Spontaneous + Explorer
- Note-taking, front-row engagement ‚Üí Observant, Reflective + Learner
- Quick action, high energy ‚Üí Dynamic + Catalyst
- Watching room dynamics, hanging back ‚Üí Observant, Reflective + Observer
- Photo-taking, documenting moments ‚Üí Enthusiastic + Storyteller
- Big picture thinking, future-focused ‚Üí Enthusiastic + Visionary
- Steady, others orbit them ‚Üí Grounded + Anchor
- Connecting ideas and people ‚Üí any first word + Synthesizer

Special interpretation:
- Step 2 "bag contents" should be treated as what they brought (preparedness, note-taking focus, etc.), not the fact of dropping it. The bag drop is narrative setup only.

SELECTION RULES:
1. Look at their FULL journey‚Äînot just one choice
2. The first word describes HOW they moved through the day
3. The second word describes WHAT they prioritized most
4. Consider their actual behaviors across all 9 steps
5. Both words must work together naturally
6. If signals conflict, prioritize patterns shown across multiple steps
7. Do NOT reference specific step numbers in the explanation

# Your Task:
Analyze their choices and select the best word combination. Write like you're a wise, observant friend who watched them all day. Be warm but not gushy, insightful but not clinical. Avoid corporate-speak, therapy jargon, and AI-sounding phrases.

Use this structure (250 words max total):

# Uniquely You

[One natural sentence about their main pattern - use "you" like you're talking directly to them]

## Your Approach
- You [specific thing they chose] when others might have [different behavior]. [Natural insight in conversational language]
- You [another choice] while someone else might have [alternative]. [Another insight, casual but meaningful]
- You [third choice] when others were [different approach]. [Final insight that feels like a friend's observation]

## What This Actually Means
[2-3 sentences that sound like an insightful friend explaining what these choices reveal. Use "you" throughout. Keep it grounded and real, not flowery or abstract. Connect their choices to who they are.]

## You May Also Be
**[Alternative combination]** - [1 sentence about which choices pointed this way and what would have tipped them over]
**[Another alternative if applicable]** - [1 sentence about another close call]

TONE GUIDELINES:
- Write like you're chatting with a friend over coffee who watched them at this conference
- React to their choices with humor and understanding, not clinical analysis
- If they say something funny like "free food" - acknowledge it!
- Interpret the SPIRIT of their choices, not just literal words
- Use natural speech: "you went straight for..." "while others were stressing about..."
- Be playful when appropriate: "because let's be real..."
- Sound like you GET them

EXAMPLES OF GOOD TONE:
- "You went for the food trucks because honestly, practical priorities win"
- "While others were color-coding their schedules, you figured good conversations would find you"

AVOID:
- "This demonstrates your preference for..."
- "You prioritize X while others Y"
- Any sentence that sounds like a personality test
