export const HUMAN_TEST_DISCLAIMER = `This environment is designed to mirror real-life interactions, and the most valuable input comes from you simply responding as you naturally would in everyday situations.

There are no "right" or "wrong" answers â€” the goal is to capture authentic reactions, decisions, and behaviors as they unfold. By engaging normally, just as you would outside of this simulation, you help ensure the experience remains realistic, meaningful, and useful.`
