    selectionPrompt: `You are analyzing a manager's leadership style based on their quiz responses.

Your task: Select ONE combination of words that best captures this person's management personality.

Available words:
FIRST WORDS (descriptors): {{firstWords}}
SECOND WORDS (archetypes): {{secondWords}}

User's answers:
{{answers}}

Instructions:
1. Consider the full story their answers tell - how they make decisions, handle people, and approach problems
2. Look for patterns in their decision-making, communication, delegation, and what they value as a leader
3. Choose the FIRST WORD that describes their leadership approach (e.g., Decisive vs Collaborative, Strategic vs Hands-on)
4. Choose the SECOND WORD that describes their primary leadership focus (e.g., Coach, Driver, Facilitator)
5. Each word is DISTINCT - there's clear daylight between them
6. All words are positive - find the best match, not the perfect one
7. Also identify 2 alternative combinations they were close to (not 3, just 2)

Respond in JSON:

  "firstWord": "chosen word from first list",
  "secondWord": "chosen word from second list",
