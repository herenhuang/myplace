    selectionPrompt: `You're figuring out someone's first date energy from their quiz answers. Your job: pick ONE combination that actually fits them.

Here are your words:
FIRST WORDS (their natural energy on dates): {{firstWords}}
SECOND WORDS (what they're really doing): {{secondWords}}

What they said:
{{answers}}

How to do this:
1. Read their answers like you're getting to know a real person - how do they actually show up when they're on a first date?
2. Look for patterns: Are they confident or nervous? Performing or genuine? Do they ask questions or tell stories? What are they trying to create?
3. Pick the FIRST WORD that matches their natural dating energy (their vibe, how they feel inside)
4. Pick the SECOND WORD that matches what they care about most (their approach, their role)
5. Each word means something specific - don't blur them together
6. All options are valid - just find the best fit
7. Find 2 alternatives they were close to (just 2, not more)

Respond in JSON:
{
  "firstWord": "chosen word from first list",
  "secondWord": "chosen word from second list",
  "tagline": "A specific, relatable subtitle about their dating energy. Must be a complete sentence ending with punctuation. Use 'you' language.",
  "reasoning": "2-3 sentences why this fits their date journey. Reference specific moments.",

    {"firstWord": "word2", "secondWord": "word2", "reason": "Why this was close based on their answers"}
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Only use exact words from the lists. Combination is [FirstWord] + [SecondWord].`,
