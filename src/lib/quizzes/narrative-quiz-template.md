```markdown
## Q1: opening-scene
**Type:** HARD-CODED

### Narrative:
You're at your desk when the notification comes through. Alex Chen, the founder you've been tracking for months, just accepted your LinkedIn request. Your heart races.

### Options:

  - "Continue"

---

## Q2: the-message
**Type:** HARD-CODED

### Options:
- **continue** ‚Üí Q3
  - "Continue"

---

## Q3: first-real-choice
**Type:** OPEN-ENDED

### Narrative:
You decide to respond immediately. What do you write?
```

---

## Question Types Explained:

### `OPEN-ENDED`
User types their own answer in a text box. No pre-written options.
- **Best for:** Getting genuine, personal responses
- **Example:** "What's going through your mind right now?"

### `HARD-CODED`
Multiple choice with 2-4 fixed options. User clicks one.
- **Best for:** Guiding specific narrative paths or measuring clear choices
- **Example:** "Do you go to the party?" ‚Üí "Yes" / "No" / "Maybe later"
- **Can branch:** Each option can lead to different next questions

### `HYBRID`
Shows pre-written options AND lets user write their own answer if they want.
- **Best for:** Flexibility - give options but allow creativity
- **Example:** Shows 3 response templates + "Or write your own..."

---

## Q1: arrival-time
**Type:** `OPEN-ENDED` *(required - choose OPEN-ENDED, HARD-CODED, or HYBRID)*
**Dimension:** timing *(optional - internal label for what this tests, not shown to user)*
**Time Marker:** Day 1, 9:00am *(optional - for narrative continuity, not shown to user)*

### Narrative:
Good morning {{name}}! You wake up to a text from {{friendName}}. There's a party tonight at Jordan's place. It starts at 6pm but people will be there until midnight. When are you planning to show up, and why that time?

### Narrative:

### Options:
- **confident** ‚Üí Q3
  - "Wave back and walk straight over with a smile"

# Notes & Tips

## What's Required vs Optional:

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED (Quiz won't work without these):
- **Meta Information** - Quiz ID, title, type
- **Theme Configuration** - Colors and styling
- **Questions** - At least 1 question

### ‚≠ï OPTIONAL (Delete entire sections if not needed):
- **Personalization Form** - Skip if you don't need user input before quiz
- **Story Setup** - Skip if you don't need narrative intro screen
- **Custom Images** - Skip to use defaults
- **Analyzing Messages** - Skip to use defaults
- **Word Matrix** - Skip if using fixed personalities (archetype type)
- **AI Explanation** - Skip for static results

**The converter will only include what you provide - missing sections are automatically skipped!**

## Writing Voice: Who Are You Talking To?

### üìù Story/Narrative Sections (User-Facing)
Write as if speaking **TO the user** - they're the protagonist:
- ‚úÖ "You wake up to a text from {{friendName}}..."
- ‚úÖ "{{name}}, are you ready?"
- ‚úÖ "What do you do?"
- ‚úÖ "You're chatting with Sam when..."

**These appear on screen during the quiz. The user is experiencing the story.**

### ü§ñ AI Prompt Sections (System-Facing)
Write as if instructing **the AI about the user** - you're giving analysis instructions:
- ‚úÖ "You're analyzing someone's social style..."
- ‚úÖ "Pick the best combination for **them**..."
- ‚úÖ "Reference specific things **they** said..."
- ‚úÖ "Talk about what **they** demonstrated..."

**These are backend instructions. The AI is analyzing "them" (the quiz taker).**

### üíæ What Gets Saved vs Displayed:
- **User's answers** = Saved and analyzed ‚úÖ
- **Your base scenario text** = Saved for context ‚úÖ
- **AI-adapted narrative flavor** = Shown to user for immersion, but NOT saved/analyzed ‚ùå

This means the AI only analyzes what the **user actually wrote**, not its own embellishments!

### ‚úçÔ∏è How AI Adaptation Works:
**YOU write the full question every time.** The AI just adds conversational glue.

**Example - What you write for Q3:**
```
You get a text from the founder. They want to know more about your background. What do you say?
```

**What the AI might adapt it to for display:**
```
After you mentioned {{previousAnswer}} in your intro, the founder texts: "Tell me more about your experience with {{topic}}." What do you say?
```

**Key point:** You always write the complete narrative. AI just personalizes the setup slightly based on previous answers. Your question is always the foundation.

---

## Question Type Guide:
- **OPEN-ENDED**: Free text input only, no predefined options
- **HARD-CODED**: Multiple choice only, fixed options with branching
- **HYBRID**: Both predefined options AND custom input field

## Placeholder Variables:
- Use `{{variableName}}` for personalization data (from form)
- Use `{{crowd_size}}` for AI-generated context
- AI will adapt these naturally in Q2+ narrative text

## Branching Logic:
- Use `‚Üí Q3` notation to show which question comes next
- If no branch specified, goes to next question in order
- Custom inputs can be analyzed for branching too

### Branching Example: Different paths converge later

**Scenario:** Q2 asks "Take the call or text instead?" Both lead to different Q3s, then merge at Q4.

```markdown
## Q2: call-decision
**Type:** HARD-CODED

### Narrative:
The founder's calling. Do you pick up?

### Options:
- **take-call** ‚Üí Q3a-phone-conversation
  - "Pick up the call"
- **text-instead** ‚Üí Q3b-text-conversation
  - "Let it go to voicemail, text back"

---

## Q3a-phone-conversation
**Type:** OPEN-ENDED

### Narrative:
You pick up. "Hey! Tell me about your background," they say. What do you tell them?

---

## Q3b-text-conversation
**Type:** OPEN-ENDED

### Narrative:
You text: "Sorry, missed your call!" They reply: "No worries. Tell me about your background?" What do you write back?

---

## Q4: investment-thesis
**Type:** OPEN-ENDED

### Narrative:
The founder wants to know your investment thesis. What do you tell them?

*Note: Both Q3a and Q3b lead here. AI will adapt framing based on call vs text.*
```

### Alternative: Same question, AI adapts context

If the question is fundamentally the same (just different medium), you can skip branching:

```markdown
## Q2: call-decision
### Options:
- **take-call** ‚Üí Q3
- **text-instead** ‚Üí Q3

## Q3: background-question
### Narrative:
The founder wants to know about your background. What do you tell them?

*AI will adapt: "You pick up..." vs "You text back..." based on Q2.*
```

## Dimensions (Optional Metadata):
Internal labels for what each question tests (e.g., "vulnerability", "conflict-handling").
- **NOT shown to users** - this is just for YOU to organize
- Can help AI understand intent when analyzing answers
- **Can be left blank or deleted** - totally optional

## Time Markers (Optional Metadata):
Tracks narrative time progression (e.g., "Day 1, 9am" ‚Üí "Day 2, 11pm").
- **NOT shown to users** - this is just for YOU to track story flow
- Useful only if your quiz has time-based continuity
- **Can be left blank or deleted** - not required
