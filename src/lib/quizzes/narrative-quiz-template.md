# Notes & Tips

## What's Required vs Optional:

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED (Quiz won't work without these):
- **Meta Information** - Quiz ID, title, type
- **Theme Configuration** - Colors and styling
- **Questions** - At least 1 question

### ‚≠ï OPTIONAL (Delete entire sections if not needed):
- **Personalization Form** - Skip if you don't need user input before quiz
- **Story Setup** - Skip if you don't need narrative intro screen
- **Custom Images** - Skip to use defaults
- **Analyzing Messages** - Skip to use defaults
- **Word Matrix** - Skip if using fixed personalities (archetype type)
- **AI Explanation** - Skip for static results

**The converter will only include what you provide - missing sections are automatically skipped!**

## Writing Voice: Who Are You Talking To?

### üìù Story/Narrative Sections (User-Facing)
Write as if speaking **TO the user** - they're the protagonist:
- ‚úÖ "You wake up to a text from {{friendName}}..."
- ‚úÖ "{{name}}, are you ready?"
- ‚úÖ "What do you do?"
- ‚úÖ "You're chatting with Sam when..."

**These appear on screen during the quiz. The user is experiencing the story.**

### ü§ñ AI Prompt Sections (System-Facing)
Write as if instructing **the AI about the user** - you're giving analysis instructions:
- ‚úÖ "You're analyzing someone's social style..."
- ‚úÖ "Pick the best combination for **them**..."
- ‚úÖ "Reference specific things **they** said..."
- ‚úÖ "Talk about what **they** demonstrated..."

**These are backend instructions. The AI is analyzing "them" (the quiz taker).**

### üíæ What Gets Saved vs Displayed:
- **User's answers** = Saved and analyzed ‚úÖ
- **Your base scenario text** = Saved for context ‚úÖ
- **AI-adapted narrative flavor** = Shown to user for immersion, but NOT saved/analyzed ‚ùå

This means the AI only analyzes what the **user actually wrote**, not its own embellishments!

---

## Question Type Guide:
- **OPEN-ENDED**: Free text input only, no predefined options
- **HARD-CODED**: Multiple choice only, fixed options with branching
- **HYBRID**: Both predefined options AND custom input field

## Placeholder Variables:

- If no branch specified, goes to next question in order
- Custom inputs can be analyzed for branching too

## Dimensions (Optional Metadata):
Internal labels for what each question tests (e.g., "vulnerability", "conflict-handling").
- **NOT shown to users** - this is just for YOU to organize
- Can help AI understand intent when analyzing answers
- **Can be left blank or deleted** - totally optional

## Time Markers (Optional Metadata):
Tracks narrative time progression (e.g., "Day 1, 9am" ‚Üí "Day 2, 11pm").

- Useful only if your quiz has time-based continuity
- **Can be left blank or deleted** - not required
