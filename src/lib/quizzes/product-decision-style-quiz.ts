    selectionPrompt: `You're figuring out someone's product decision style from their quiz answers. Your job: pick ONE combination that actually fits them.

Here are your words:
FIRST WORDS (how they make decisions): {{firstWords}}
SECOND WORDS (what they're really about): {{secondWords}}

What they said:
{{answers}}

How to do this:
1. Read their answers like you're getting to know a real person - how do they actually make product calls when it matters?
2. Look for patterns: Do they follow data or gut? Do they ship fast or wait? Do they protect the vision or adapt? What do they trust most?
3. Pick the FIRST WORD that matches their natural decision approach (their style, their instinct)
4. Pick the SECOND WORD that matches what they care about most (their role, their priority)
5. Each word means something specific - don't blur them together
6. All options are valid - just find the best fit
7. Find 2 alternatives they were close to (just 2, not more)

Respond in JSON:
{
  "firstWord": "chosen word from first list",
  "secondWord": "chosen word from second list",
  "tagline": "A specific subtitle about their decision style. Must be a complete sentence ending with punctuation. Use 'you' language.",
  "reasoning": "2-3 sentences why this fits. Reference specific scenarios.",

    {"firstWord": "word1", "secondWord": "word1", "reason": "Brief reason"},
    {"firstWord": "word2", "secondWord": "word2", "reason": "Brief reason"}
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Only use exact words from lists. Combination is [FirstWord] + [SecondWord].`,

TARGET LENGTH: ~1500-2000 words total. Be conversational but economical with words.

Write like you're having a real conversation - warm, direct, no corporate BS. Think Bren√© Brown vibes: honest, grounded, human.

<section>
# {{archetype}}
{{tagline}}

## Your Decision-Making Blueprint
Talk about how they naturally make product decisions. Keep it real and conversational - like you're explaining something you noticed about them over coffee. Reference specific things they said in the quiz.
</section>

<section>
## What I Noticed
Point out 3 specific patterns from their actual answers. Be direct and warm:
- When you said [specific answer], I saw [what this means about them]
- The way you approached [specific scenario] tells me [insight]
- [Another connection between what they said and who they are]
</section>

<section>
## You're Also Close To...
{{alternatives}}

For each alternative, explain in 1-2 sentences why they've got some of this energy too. Keep it conversational - "You've also got some [style] in you when..."
</section>

<section>
## What Works For You
Share 2-3 things that are genuinely great about being a {{archetype}}. Be specific and real - no corporate fluff. What actually makes this work?

</section>

<section>
## Personality Predictions

Based on their decision style and quiz answers, here's your read on their personality:

**MBTI Type: [4-LETTER TYPE] ([XX]% confident)**
In 1-2 conversational sentences, explain why this MBTI type fits based on how they answered. Reference specific behaviors they showed. Be honest about confidence - if it's their first quiz or answers were mixed, use lower percentages (15-40%). If patterns are clear, go higher (60-85%).

**Big Five Traits:**
Output EXACTLY in this format (just the numbers, 0-100 scale):
- Openness: [0-100]
- Conscientiousness: [0-100]
- Extraversion: [0-100]
- Agreeableness: [0-100]
- Neuroticism: [0-100]

Then add 1-2 conversational sentences about what stands out in their Big Five profile.
</section>

<section>
## Bottom Line
One real, empowering sentence about what makes their {{archetype}} style valuable. No fluff - just truth.
</section>

Their full decision patterns:
{{answers}}

IMPORTANT: 2-3 sentences per section MAX. Use contractions (you're, don't, can't, it's). Short, punchy sentences. No fluff - if you can cut a word, cut it. Make every word earn its place. Read it out loud - if it sounds weird to say, rewrite it. Use "{{archetype}}" exactly as written. Make them feel seen, not evaluated.`
