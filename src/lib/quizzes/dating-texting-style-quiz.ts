    selectionPrompt: `You're figuring out someone's dating texting style from their quiz answers. Your job: pick ONE combination that actually fits them.

Here are your words:
FIRST WORDS (their texting energy): {{firstWords}}
SECOND WORDS (what they actually do): {{secondWords}}

What they said:
{{answers}}

How to do this:
1. Read their answers like you're getting to know a real person - how do they actually text when they like someone?
2. Look for patterns: Are they quick or slow? Anxious or chill? Do they double-text? What's their emoji situation? How do they handle silence?
3. Pick the FIRST WORD that matches their natural texting energy (their vibe, their speed)
4. Pick the SECOND WORD that matches what they care about most (their behavior, their pattern)
5. Each word means something specific - don't blur them together
6. All options are valid - just find the best fit
7. Find 2 alternatives they were close to (just 2, not more)

Respond in JSON:
{
  "firstWord": "chosen word from first list",
  "secondWord": "chosen word from second list",
  "tagline": "A specific, relatable subtitle about their texting. Must be a complete sentence ending with punctuation. Use 'you' language.",
  "reasoning": "2-3 sentences why this fits their texting patterns. Reference specific behaviors.",
  "alternatives": [
    {"firstWord": "word1", "secondWord": "word1", "reason": "Why this was close"},
    {"firstWord": "word2", "secondWord": "word2", "reason": "Why this was close"}
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Only use exact words from lists. Combination is [FirstWord] + [SecondWord].`,

# {{archetype}}

</section>

<section>

## Personality Predictions

Based on their texting style and quiz answers, here's your read on their personality:

**MBTI Type: [4-LETTER TYPE] ([XX]% confident)**
In 1-2 conversational sentences, explain why this MBTI type fits based on how they answered. Reference specific behaviors they showed. Be honest about confidence - if it's their first quiz or answers were mixed, use lower percentages (15-40%). If patterns are clear, go higher (60-85%).

**Big Five Traits:**
Output EXACTLY in this format (just the numbers, 0-100 scale):
- Openness: [0-100]
- Conscientiousness: [0-100]
- Extraversion: [0-100]
- Agreeableness: [0-100]
- Neuroticism: [0-100]

Then add 1-2 conversational sentences about what stands out in their Big Five profile.
</section>

<section>
## Bottom Line
One real, empowering sentence about what makes their {{archetype}} style valuable. No fluff - just truth.
</section>

Their full texting patterns:
{{answers}}

IMPORTANT: 2-3 sentences per section MAX. Use contractions (you're, don't, can't, it's). Short, punchy sentences. No fluff - if you can cut a word, cut it. Make every word earn its place. Read it out loud - if it sounds weird to say, rewrite it. Use "{{archetype}}" exactly as written. Make them feel seen, not evaluated.`
