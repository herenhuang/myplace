    selectionPrompt: `You are analyzing someone's texting chemistry based on how they text someone they like.

Your task: Select ONE combination that captures how this person texts romantically.

Available words:
FIRST WORDS (texting energy): {{firstWords}}
SECOND WORDS (texting behavior): {{secondWords}}

User's texting patterns:
{{answers}}

IMPORTANT WARNINGS:
‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT use quiz title to create obvious combinations like "Eager Texter"
‚ö†Ô∏è AVOID boring combinations - be specific to their actual behavior
‚ö†Ô∏è SECOND WORD must grammatically complete "What's Your Dating Texting Style?" ‚Üí "What's Your [SecondWord]?" must sound natural
‚ö†Ô∏è CREATE UNEXPECTED, SPECIFIC COMBINATIONS

Instructions:
1. Analyze their texting across 8 scenarios:
   - First text timing (immediate vs measured vs strategic)
   - Response style (quick vs brief vs thoughtful)
   - No-response handling (secure vs anxious vs persistent)
   - Conversation content (flirty vs substantive vs casual)
   - Late night response (open vs bold vs analytical)
   - Emoji usage (heavy vs selective vs minimal)
   - Planning approach (decisive vs eager vs casual)
   - Day ending (sweet vs organic vs strategic)

2. Identify PRIMARY patterns:
   - Speed: eager/immediate OR strategic/patient OR chill/natural
   - Anxiety: secure/unbothered OR anxious/monitoring OR overthinking
   - Expression: expressive/emoji-heavy OR careful/crafted OR minimal/restrained
   - Confidence: bold/playful OR casual/cool OR anxious/cautious
   - Approach: initiating OR responding OR double-texting OR analyzing

3. Choose FIRST WORD for core TEXTING ENERGY
4. Choose SECOND WORD for primary BEHAVIOR/PATTERN
5. Test grammar: "What's Your [SecondWord]?" - natural?
6. Tagline must be specific (e.g., "You check your phone more than you'd admit" NOT "You text well")
7. Find 2 alternatives

Respond in JSON:
{
  "firstWord": "chosen word from first list",
  "secondWord": "chosen word from second list",
  "tagline": "A specific, relatable subtitle about their texting. Must be a complete sentence ending with punctuation. Use 'you' language.",
  "reasoning": "2-3 sentences why this fits their texting patterns. Reference specific behaviors.",
  "alternatives": [
    {"firstWord": "word1", "secondWord": "word1", "reason": "Why this was close"},
    {"firstWord": "word2", "secondWord": "word2", "reason": "Why this was close"}
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Only use exact words from lists. Combination is [FirstWord] + [SecondWord].`,
