    premise: `You've been dating Jordan for 14 months. Things are goodâ€”really good. You're basically living together already, bouncing between apartments. 

Last night, Jordan's lease renewal notice arrived. They turned to you and said: "What if we just... got a place together?"

Now it's real. This isn't hypothetical anymore.

The Timeline:
You have 6 weeks to decide before Jordan's lease is up.

The Stakes:
This could be amazing. Or it could expose cracks you haven't seen. Your friends have opinions. Your families will have opinions. But ultimately, this is about you two and what you're ready for.

Let's see how you navigate this together...`,
