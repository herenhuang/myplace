    selectionPrompt: `You are analyzing someone's romantic feelings based on their quiz responses about a specific person.

Your task: Select ONE combination that best captures the TYPE and NATURE of their feelings.

Available words:
FIRST WORDS (intensity/quality): {{firstWords}}
SECOND WORDS (type of feeling): {{secondWords}}

User's answers about this person:
{{answers}}

Instructions:
1. Look at the full picture of their feelings - physical reactions, jealousy, mental space, behavior changes
2. Consider patterns: Are they obsessive or casual? Clear or confused? Physical or emotional? New or deepening?
3. Choose the FIRST WORD that describes the INTENSITY/QUALITY of their feelings (e.g., Intense vs Subtle, Confusing vs Undeniable)
4. Choose the SECOND WORD that describes the TYPE/NATURE of their feelings (e.g., Romantic Crush, Friendship Blur, Physical Attraction)
5. Each word is DISTINCT - there's clear separation between them
6. All combinations are valid - no judgment, just accuracy
7. Create a tagline that makes them feel SEEN (e.g., "You're not imagining it - your body knows before your brain does" or "You're trying to logic your way out of feelings that won't listen to reason")
8. Identify 2 alternative combinations they were close to (not 3, just 2)

Respond in JSON:
{
  "firstWord": "chosen word from first list",
  "secondWord": "chosen word from second list",
  "tagline": "A punchy, deeply personal subtitle that captures their specific situation (use 'you' language, make it feel like you're reading their mind)",
  "reasoning": "2-3 sentences explaining why this combination fits their answers. ONLY use the exact combination [FirstWord SecondWord] - do NOT create any other names or terms.",
  "alternatives": [
    {"firstWord": "word1", "secondWord": "word1", "reason": "Brief reason why this was close based on their answers"},
    {"firstWord": "word2", "secondWord": "word2", "reason": "Brief reason why this was close based on their answers"}
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Do NOT make up names like "Real Crush" or "True Love" or "Strong Feelings". Only use exact words from the lists provided. The combination is literally [FirstWord] + [SecondWord], nothing else.`,

Write an honest, personal explanation with these sections:

## What's Actually Happening Here

Start with "You're experiencing {{archetype}}, and here's what that means..." Write 2-3 sentences about what this TYPE of feeling is like. Make sure it connects to their tagline: "{{tagline}}". Reference their actual quiz answers to show you get their specific situation.

## The Signs I'm Seeing

- When you said [specific answer], that tells me [insight about their feelings]
- Your response about [specific answer] shows [what's really going on]
- The fact that [another specific answer] is classic {{archetype}}

## You Were Also Close To...

{{alternatives}}

Write 1-2 sentences for each alternative explaining why they showed hints of it based on their answers.

## So... Do You Have a Crush?

Give them a direct, honest answer about whether this is a crush, based on {{archetype}}. Be kind but real. If it's complicated, say so.

## What to Do With This

Offer 2-3 practical suggestions tailored to {{archetype}}. Could be: sit with the feelings, talk to them, give it time, explore it, be careful, enjoy it, etc. Be specific to their situation.

## The Real Question

End with a reflective question or insight that helps them think about what they actually WANT here, given that they're experiencing {{archetype}}.

Their full answers:
{{answers}}

Use "{{archetype}}" consistently throughout (never shorten or modify it). Be warm, honest, specific to their answers, and non-judgmental. Use markdown with ## for headers. Make them feel understood.`
