The Situation:
You met three weeks ago through mutual friends. There was immediate chemistry. Last night was your first real dateâ€”dinner turned into drinks turned into walking around the city until 1am. You talked about everything. You laughed constantly. When you said goodbye, there was this moment...

This person is:
- **Alex**: Smart, funny, emotionally available (as far as you can tell). Seems genuinely interested in you. Has their life together. Green flags so far.

Now it's the next morning. You're replaying everything. Your phone is next to you. The next four weeks are going to reveal something important: how YOU fall in love.

Not how you think you do. Not how you wish you did. How you actually do.

Let's watch it unfold...`,

    selectionPrompt: `You are analyzing how someone falls in love based on their journey through the first month of a new relationship.

STORY CONTEXT:
They just met someone they really like. Over four weeks, they navigated: initial contact, vulnerability, physical intimacy, meeting friends, conflict, and defining the relationship. Each choice revealed something about their falling-in-love pattern.

Their journey through the story:
{{answers}}

Your task: Select ONE combination that captures HOW they fall in love.

Available words:
FIRST WORDS (speed/intensity): {{firstWords}}
SECOND WORDS (style/approach): {{secondWords}}

Instructions:
1. Look at the FULL arc of their journey - not just one moment
2. Consider: Speed (fast vs slow), Vulnerability (open vs guarded), Physical vs Emotional timing, Independence vs Merging, Anxiety level, Communication style
3. Choose the FIRST WORD that describes their SPEED/INTENSITY when falling (e.g., Fast-Falling vs Cautious, All-In vs Hesitant)
4. Choose the SECOND WORD that describes their STYLE/APPROACH (e.g., Heart-First Lover, Mind-Then-Heart, Anxious Overthinker)
5. Each word is DISTINCT - clear separation between options
6. All combinations are valid - no judgment about how someone falls
7. Create a tagline that makes them feel deeply SEEN about their pattern
8. Identify 2 alternative combinations they were close to

Respond in JSON:
{
  "firstWord": "chosen word from first list",
  "secondWord": "chosen word from second list",
  "tagline": "A deeply personal subtitle that captures their specific falling pattern. Must be a complete sentence ending with punctuation. Use 'you' language, make it feel like you understand them completely.",
  "reasoning": "2-3 sentences explaining why this combination fits their journey through the month. ONLY use the exact combination [FirstWord SecondWord] - do NOT create any other names.",
  "alternatives": [
    {"firstWord": "word1", "secondWord": "word1", "reason": "Why this was close based on their choices"},
    {"firstWord": "word2", "secondWord": "word2", "reason": "Why this was close based on their choices"}
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Do NOT make up names. Only use exact words from the lists provided. The combination is literally [FirstWord] + [SecondWord], nothing else.`,
