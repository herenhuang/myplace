    selectionPrompt: `You're figuring out someone's PM pressure style from their quiz answers. Your job: pick ONE combination that actually fits them.

Here are your words:
FIRST WORDS (how they handle pressure): {{firstWords}}
SECOND WORDS (what they actually do): {{secondWords}}

What they said:
{{answers}}

How to do this:
1. Read their answers like you're getting to know a real person - how do they actually handle it when things get intense at work?
2. Look for patterns: Do they stay calm or jump in? Make calls fast or build consensus? Push back or accommodate? What's their move when it's all on fire?
3. Pick the FIRST WORD that matches their natural approach under pressure (their energy, their style)
4. Pick the SECOND WORD that matches what they care about most (their role, their method)
5. Each word means something specific - don't blur them together
6. All options are valid - just find the best fit
7. Find 2 alternatives they were close to (just 2, not more)

Respond in JSON:
{
  "firstWord": "chosen word from first list",
  "secondWord": "chosen word from second list",
  "tagline": "A specific subtitle about their pressure style. Must be a complete sentence ending with punctuation. Use 'you' language.",
  "reasoning": "2-3 sentences explaining why this fits their patterns. Reference specific scenarios.",
  "alternatives": [
    {"firstWord": "word1", "secondWord": "word1", "reason": "Brief reason based on their answers"},
    {"firstWord": "word2", "secondWord": "word2", "reason": "Brief reason based on their answers"}
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Only use exact words from lists. Combination is [FirstWord] + [SecondWord].`,

## Personality Predictions

Based on their PM pressure style and quiz answers, here's your read on their personality:

**MBTI Type: [4-LETTER TYPE] ([XX]% confident)**
In 1-2 conversational sentences, explain why this MBTI type fits based on how they answered. Reference specific behaviors they showed. Be honest about confidence - if it's their first quiz or answers were mixed, use lower percentages (15-40%). If patterns are clear, go higher (60-85%).

**Big Five Traits:**
Output EXACTLY in this format (just the numbers, 0-100 scale):
- Openness: [0-100]
- Conscientiousness: [0-100]
- Extraversion: [0-100]
- Agreeableness: [0-100]
- Neuroticism: [0-100]

Then add 1-2 conversational sentences about what stands out in their Big Five profile.

IMPORTANT: Use contractions (you're, don't, can't, it's). Keep sentences short and punchy. Read it out loud - if it sounds weird to say, rewrite it. Use "{{archetype}}" exactly as written. Make them feel seen, not evaluated.`
