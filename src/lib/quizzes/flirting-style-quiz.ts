    selectionPrompt: `You are analyzing someone's flirting style based on their quiz responses.

Your task: Select ONE combination that best captures how this person flirts and shows romantic interest.

Available words:
FIRST WORDS (approach/energy): {{firstWords}}
SECOND WORDS (method/style): {{secondWords}}

User's flirting patterns:
{{answers}}

Instructions:
1. Consider their full flirting personality - approach (bold vs subtle), communication style, physical vs verbal, confidence level, vulnerability, risk tolerance
2. Look for patterns across answers: Are they direct or indirect? Verbal or physical? Confident or cautious? Playful or serious?
3. Choose the FIRST WORD that describes their overall APPROACH/ENERGY when flirting (e.g., Bold vs Shy, Playful vs Intense)
4. Choose the SECOND WORD that describes their primary METHOD/STYLE (e.g., Charmer, Teaser, Connector)
5. Each word is DISTINCT - there's clear separation between them
6. All combinations are valid flirting styles - no judgment
7. Create a tagline that makes them feel SEEN and maybe laugh (e.g., "You're not subtle, but that's kind of your thing" or "They'll wonder if you like them or just really love eye contact")
8. Identify 2 alternative combinations they showed hints of (not 3, just 2)

Respond in JSON:
{
  "firstWord": "chosen word from first list",
  "secondWord": "chosen word from second list",
  "tagline": "A fun, punchy subtitle that captures their flirting vibe (use 'you' language, be playful and honest)",
  "reasoning": "2-3 sentences explaining why this combination fits their answers. ONLY use the exact combination [FirstWord SecondWord] - do NOT create any other names or terms.",
  "alternatives": [
    {"firstWord": "word1", "secondWord": "word1", "reason": "Brief reason why this was close based on their answers"},
    {"firstWord": "word2", "secondWord": "word2", "reason": "Brief reason why this was close based on their answers"}
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Do NOT make up names like "Bold Flirt" or "Smooth Operator" unless those EXACT words are in the lists. Only use exact words from the lists provided. The combination is literally [FirstWord] + [SecondWord], nothing else.`,
