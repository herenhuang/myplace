# Bubble Popper Game - Setup & Changes

## What's New ‚ú®

### 1. **Uses Word Association Pattern** ‚úÖ
- Follows the same data persistence pattern as word association game
- Uses **server actions** (`actions.ts`) instead of API routes
- Saves to **`sessions` table** (no custom table needed!)
- No SQL setup required - everything just works!

### 2. **Play History & Varying One-Liners**
- Tracks your play history in localStorage (last 10 games)
- One-liner commentary changes each time you play!
- Comments reference your play count ("Third time and still not buying it?", "Again?! You really hate this.")
- Makes repeat plays more engaging

### 3. **Shorter AI Assessments**
- Reduced from 3-4 paragraphs to just 2 short paragraphs (3-4 sentences each)
- More punchy and direct
- Easier to read and more impactful

### 4. **Global Statistics & Comparisons**
- Your games are saved to `sessions` table
- Compare with all other players:
  - Total plays worldwide
  - Your percentile for completion and speed
  - Global averages
  - Achievement badges ("Completionist!", "Above average!")

### 5. **Updated Results Card Design**
- Removed "Behavioral Observation" title
- Shows only 2 stats: **Bubbles Popped (%)** and **Time**
- Sunken appearance with transparency and backdrop blur
- Subtle inset shadow instead of elevated
- Cleaner, more integrated look

### 6. **Fixed Bubble Shadows**
- Reduced shadow intensity to prevent cutoff
- Added padding to grid container
- Bubbles now have subtle shadows that don't get clipped

## No Database Setup Required! üéâ

The game uses the existing `sessions` table that's already set up in your Supabase database. No additional SQL scripts needed!

It works exactly like the word association game:
- Saves to `sessions` table with `game_id: 'bubble-popper'`
- Includes user_id, session_id, game data, and AI analysis result
- Automatically tracks anonymous users
- Global stats are calculated by querying all bubble-popper sessions

## Files Modified üìù

1. **`src/app/bubble-popper/actions.ts`** (NEW FILE)
   - `saveAndAnalyze()` - Generates AI analysis and saves to sessions table
   - `getGlobalStats()` - Fetches and calculates global statistics
   - Follows word association pattern exactly

2. **`src/app/bubble-popper/page.tsx`**
   - Uses `useTransition` for async state management
   - Imports and calls server actions directly
   - Session management with `getOrCreateSessionId()`
   - Anonymous auth support
   - Added play history tracking in localStorage
   - Implemented varying one-liners with multiple variations per category
   - Updated result card to show only 2 stats (bubbles as %, time)
   - Removed "Behavioral Observation" subtitle

3. **`src/app/bubble-popper/page.module.scss`**
   - Changed result card to transparent with backdrop blur
   - Updated to inset shadow for sunken appearance
   - Added border with slight transparency
   - Reduced bubble shadows and added grid padding
   - Updated one-liner styling for better readability

## Testing Checklist ‚úÖ

1. **Play Once**: Get initial one-liner
2. **Play Again**: Notice different one-liner for same behavior
3. **Play 3+ Times**: See play-count-aware comments ("Third time...")
4. **Check Assessment**: Should be 2 short paragraphs, not long
5. **Check Result Card**: Sunken appearance, only 2 stats (% and time)
6. **Check Bubbles**: Shadows shouldn't be cut off at edges
7. **Global Stats**: Should see worldwide comparisons automatically!

## Quick Commands

```bash
# If dev server isn't running:
cd /Users/helen/Documents/neworange/myplace && npm run dev

# Then visit:
# http://localhost:3000/bubble-popper
```

## How It Works

The game now follows the exact pattern as word association:

1. **On Game End**: Calls `saveAndAnalyze(gameData, sessionId)`
2. **Server Action**: Generates AI analysis via Claude API
3. **Database Save**: Saves to `sessions` table with all game data
4. **Stats Fetch**: Queries `sessions` table filtered by `game_id: 'bubble-popper'`
5. **Comparison**: Calculates averages and percentiles from all saved games

Everything is persistent, trackable, and works across all users automatically! üöÄ
