# ✨ Quiz Recommendation System - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 What We Built

A personalized, AI-powered quiz recommendation system that feels like getting a thoughtful note from a friend who really gets you.

### The Experience

```

Clicks "See Why" → reads AI explanation
   ↓
Scrolls down... and discovers a beautiful "ps." footer
   ↓
Watches cycling messages: "Reading between the lines..."
   ↓
Personalized recommendation appears! 🎯
   ↓
"Based on how you said [specific thing]... you should try [quiz]"

```

  recommended_quiz_id,
  COUNT(*) as shown,
  COUNT(clicked_at) as clicked,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(clicked_at) / COUNT(*), 2) as ctr
FROM quiz_recommendations
GROUP BY source_quiz_id, recommended_quiz_id
ORDER BY ctr DESC;
```

### Popular Quiz Journeys
```sql
SELECT
  source_quiz_id,
  recommended_quiz_id,
  COUNT(*) as times_recommended
FROM quiz_recommendations
WHERE clicked_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY source_quiz_id, recommended_quiz_id
ORDER BY times_recommended DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🎯 Example AI Recommendations

### After Crush Quiz → Flirting Style
```
Okay so you lit up at their name and felt that "weird pang"
when they mentioned dating someone else...

You're definitely crushing.

Try "What's Your Flirting Style?" and see how you actually
show that interest (because right now you might be giving
mixed signals 👀)
```

### After Manager Style → Feedback Style
```
I noticed you don't sugarcoat—like at all. You said you'd
speak up in the moment and make the call quickly.

Wanna see if that directness shows up when giving feedback?

Take "What's Your Feedback Style?" My guess? You're not
a sandwich method person. 😏
```

### After Feedback Style → Flirting Style (Cross-Domain!)
```
You're all about direct, honest communication at work—that
came through in every answer.

But here's what I'm curious about: does that same energy
show up when you're into someone?

Try "What's Your Flirting Style?" I'm betting your candor
translates, just in a different context. 👀
```

## 🎨 The Magic Moment

When a user scrolls down after reading their explanation and sees:

> **ps.**
>
> I noticed you avoid touch until you're SURE and wait for them to make the first move... Classic slow burn energy.
>
> Curious how that patience shows up once you're actually falling for someone?
>
> **✨ How Do You Fall in Love?** is going to feel very seen for you.

That "OMG they know me" feeling? **That's the goal. And we built it!** 🎉
