# Personalization Template for Narrative Quizzes

## üéØ What This Is

A complete system for creating **personalized narrative quizzes** where users input their own details (names, timelines, situations) and the entire story adapts to them.

**Use this template to create quizzes about:**
- Relationships (moving in, getting married, dating)
- Career decisions (job changes, starting a business)
- Life transitions (moving cities, having kids, retiring)
- Any narrative where personal context matters!

## üìã The Template Structure

### 1. Add Personalization Form

```typescript
personalizationForm: {
  instructions: "Brief explanation of what you're collecting",
  fields: [
    {
      id: 'fieldName',              // Use as {{fieldName}} in text
      question: "What to ask user",
      type: 'text' | 'select',      // Input type
      placeholder: 'Default value', // For text inputs
      options: ['Option 1', '...'], // For select inputs
      required: true | false        // Default: true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Use Placeholders in Story Setup

```typescript
storySetup: {
  title: "Your Story Title",
  premise: `Use {{placeholders}} anywhere in your text.
  
  You've been dating {{partnerName}} for {{relationshipLength}}.
  {{currentSituation}}.
  
  The {{placeholders}} will be replaced with user's actual inputs!`,
  timeframe: "Duration of story",
  characters: [
    {
      name: "{{partnerName}}",  // Can use placeholders in character names!
      role: "Their role",
      personality: "Description"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Use Placeholders in Questions (Optional)

```typescript
questions: [
  {
    id: 'q1',
    baseScenario: {
      timeMarker: "Day 1",
      dimension: "what_this_tests",
      coreSetup: `{{partnerName}} asks you something...` // Personalized!
    },
    options: [...]
  }
]
```

  // STEP 2: Use placeholders in story
  storySetup: {
    title: "Should You Get Married?",
    premise: `You've been with {{partnerName}} for {{relationshipLength}}. Things are serious.

{{whoSuggested}}, and now the question is hanging in the air: marriage.

{{currentPressure}} about making this decision.

Over the next few weeks, you'll face moments that reveal how you really feel about forever with {{partnerName}}.

Let's see what you discover...`,
    timeframe: "4 weeks",
    characters: [
      {
        name: "{{partnerName}}",
        role: "Your partner",
        personality: "Loves you, wants to know you're on the same page"
      }
    ]
  },
  
  // STEP 3: Questions can use placeholders too

        timeMarker: "Week 1",

      ],
      allowCustomInput: true
    },
    // ... more questions

## üí° Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- **Collect essentials only** - 3-5 fields max
- **Use placeholders liberally** - Makes it feel personal
- **Make defaults work** - Placeholder values should make sense
- **Test without personalization** - Story should still work with defaults

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- **Over-collect** - Don't ask for 10 fields
- **Make it awkward** - Test how placeholders read in sentences
- **Assume all filled** - Handle missing optional fields gracefully
- **Forget character names** - {{partnerName}} in characters array!
