## When User Requests: "Create a [TOPIC] quiz"

Follow this exact process:

### Step 1: Understand the Topic
Ask yourself:
- What are the core dimensions of this topic?
- What are the different APPROACHES people take? (first words)
- What are the different PRIORITIES people have? (second words)
- Are there 10 truly distinct options for each?

### Step 2: Create the 10x10 Word Matrix

**First Words (HOW they approach the topic):**
- Must be 10 DISTINCTLY different approaches
- Each should be recognizable and clear
- Should span a spectrum of possibilities
- Test: "Could someone be BOTH X and Y?" If yes, they're too similar

**Second Words (WHAT they prioritize in the topic):**
- Must be 10 DISTINCTLY different priorities
- Each should represent a clear value/focus
- Should cover diverse interests
- Test: "Are these meaningfully different?" If not, refine

### Step 3: Design 8 Strategic Questions

Each question must map to specific dimensions:

**Q1**: Primary approach/style (maps to 3-4 first words)
**Q2**: Core value/priority (maps to 3-4 second words)
**Q3**: Social dimension (maps to social/independent spectrum)
**Q4**: Energy/pace dimension (maps to energetic/relaxed spectrum)
**Q5**: Resource allocation (maps to budget/comfort/etc)
**Q6**: Risk tolerance (maps to bold/cautious spectrum)
**Q7**: Adaptability (maps to structured/flexible spectrum)
**Q8**: Success definition (maps to outcome priorities)

**Question Format:**
- Action-oriented, not hypothetical
- 3 distinct options (not 4!)
- Options should be equally appealing
- Enable custom input on ALL questions
- Use storytelling: "You're in [situation]..."

### Step 4: Write the AI Prompts

**Selection Prompt Structure:**
```
You are analyzing a [TOPIC] personality.

Your task: Select ONE combination that best captures this person.

Available words:
FIRST WORDS: [list]
SECOND WORDS: [list]

User's answers:
{{answers}}

Instructions:
1. Consider the full story their answers tell
2. Choose FIRST WORD describing their approach
3. Choose SECOND WORD describing their priority
4. Each word is DISTINCT
5. Identify 2 alternatives they were close to

Respond in JSON:
{
  "firstWord": "...",
  "secondWord": "...",
  "reasoning": "ONLY use exact combination - no other names",
  "alternatives": [
    {"firstWord": "...", "secondWord": "...", "reason": "..."},
    {"firstWord": "...", "secondWord": "...", "reason": "..."}
  ]
}

IMPORTANT: Do NOT make up new names.
```

**Explanation Prompt Structure:**
```
You're a [TOPIC] expert. They are a "{{archetype}}".

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES:
1. ONLY use "{{archetype}}" - no other names
2. Do NOT create variations
3. Do NOT add "The" or "A"
4. You will be penalized for making up names

## Your [Topic] DNA
Start with "As an {{archetype}}, you..."

## What I Noticed

## You Were Also Close To...
{{alternatives}}

## Tips for Your Next [Activity]
Actionable tips for {{archetype}}.

## Where This Takes You
Inspiring closing using {{archetype}}.

Their answers:
{{answers}}
```

### Step 5: Choose Theme Colors

**Default: Always start with neutral tones**
- Primary: `#8b7355`, Secondary: `#c9b8a3`, Background: `#fafafa`, Text: `#2c2c2c`

**Only customize if topic has strong color association:**
- **Adventure/Travel**: Blues, aquas (`#4a90e2`, `#7ec8e3`)
- **Nature/Wellness**: Greens (`#52b788`, `#95d5b2`)
- **Food/Lifestyle**: Warm tones (`#ff6b35`, `#ffa500`)
- **Professional/Work**: Grays, blues (`#6b7280`, `#9ca3af`)

**When in doubt, use neutral!**

- ‚úÖ All 8 questions with IDs
