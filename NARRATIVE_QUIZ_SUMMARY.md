# Narrative Quiz Type - Quick Summary

## üéâ What We Created

A **new quiz type** that enables fully immersive story-based experiences where the narrative adapts to user choices in real-time.

---

## üìö Three Quiz Types Now Available

### 1. **Archetype** (Existing)
- 4-8 fixed personalities
- Simple point-based scoring
- Example: "Which AI Model Are You?"

### 2. **Story-Matrix** (Existing)
- 100 dynamic combinations  
- 10 disconnected scenarios
- Example: "What's Your Vacation Style?"

### 3. **Narrative** (NEW!)
- 100 dynamic combinations
- **ONE continuous story that adapts**
- Example: "Your First 2 Weeks as Manager"

## üéØ The Key Innovation

### Instead of this (Story-Matrix):
```
Q1: You're at a hostel. What do you do?
Q2: You're at a restaurant. What do you do?
Q3: Plans change. What do you do?
```
‚Üí Disconnected scenarios

### You get this (Narrative):
```
Story Setup: "You're starting a 7-day solo trip to Tokyo..."

Q1: Day 1, 9am. You land at Narita Airport, jet-lagged...
User chooses: "Find a quiet caf√© to collect my thoughts"

Q2: Day 1, 11am. After that peaceful coffee break where you 
     journaled for an hour, you're feeling more grounded. Now 
     you're at your Airbnb. Your host says...
```
‚Üí Story adapts based on Q1 choice!

---

## üí° How It Works

### You Write:
**Base Scenarios** - The core scene without personalization

```typescript
{
  id: 'q5-crisis',
  baseScenario: {
    timeMarker: "Thursday 4pm",
    dimension: "crisis_management",
    coreSetup: "Production goes down. Deploy failed. Team Slack exploding. What do you do?"
  },
  options: [/* 3 actions */]
}
```

### AI Adapts:
Before showing each question, AI adds continuity:

**If user was hands-on in Q1-4:**
```
"Thursday 4pm - Week 1

You've been pretty hands-on this week, reviewing code and checking in constantly. 
Now the deploy fails and Sarah posts: 'System's down. I told you we needed more 
time.' You can sense frustration with how involved you've been. What do you do?"
```

**If user was delegating in Q1-4:**
```
"Thursday 4pm - Week 1

You've been giving the team space to self-organize. Now Sam calls: 'The deploy 
failed and everyone's looking at each other wondering who's in charge. What do 
you want us to do?'"
```

**Same base scenario, adapted to their journey!**
