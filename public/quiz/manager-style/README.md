# Manager Style Quiz - Image Assets

This directory contains image assets for the Manager Style quiz.

## Required Image:

### Background Image
- **Filename**: `background.png`
- **Dimensions**: 1200x1600px (portrait orientation)
- **Style**: Professional yet warm, suitable for management/leadership theme
- **Suggested colors**: Blues and purples (matching theme: primary #6366f1, secondary #a5b4fc)
- **Usage**: Background for quiz welcome and questions screens

### Image Generation Prompt (if using AI):

```
A subtle, professional background for a management leadership quiz. 
Soft indigo and lavender gradient (colors: #6366f1 to #a5b4fc), 
abstract geometric shapes suggesting organization and growth, 
minimalist design suitable for text overlay, portrait orientation, 
modern and approachable aesthetic.
```

## Note:
This quiz uses a **story-matrix type**, which means it generates 100 dynamic combinations 
(e.g., "Decisive Coach", "Collaborative Strategist") and does NOT need individual personality 
images. Only the background.png is required.

## Current Status:
⚠️ Background image needs to be added. Quiz will work with a fallback until image is provided.
