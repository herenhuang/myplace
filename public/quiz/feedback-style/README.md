### Image Generation Prompt (if using AI):

```
A subtle, professional background for a workplace feedback quiz. 
Warm neutral tones with browns and tans (colors: #8b7355 to #c9b8a3), 
abstract shapes suggesting communication and growth, 
minimalist design suitable for text overlay, portrait orientation, 
modern and approachable aesthetic.
```

## Note:
This quiz uses a **story-matrix type**, which means it generates 100 dynamic combinations 
(e.g., "Direct Growth-Pusher", "Empathetic Coach") and does NOT need individual personality 
images. Only the background.png is required.

## Current Status:
⚠️ Background image needs to be added. Quiz will work with a fallback until image is provided.
