## üéØ How To Use The Template

### For Any New Narrative Quiz:

```typescript
export const yourQuiz: QuizConfig = {
  id: 'your-quiz-id',
  title: 'Your Quiz Title',
  type: 'narrative',
  
  // 1. ADD PERSONALIZATION FORM
  personalizationForm: {
    instructions: "Let's personalize this for you",
    fields: [
      {
        id: 'fieldName',           // Use as {{fieldName}}
        question: "What to ask?",
        type: 'text' | 'select',
        placeholder: 'Default',    // For text
        options: ['A', 'B'],       // For select
        required: true
      }
    ]
  },
  
  // 2. USE {{PLACEHOLDERS}} IN STORY
  storySetup: {
    title: "Story Title",
    premise: `Your story with {{fieldName}} and {{otherField}}.
    
    Use placeholders anywhere - they'll be replaced!`,
    characters: [
      {
        name: "{{fieldName}}",     // Personalized character names!
        role: "Their role",
        personality: "Description"
      }
    ]
  },
  
  // 3. USE {{PLACEHOLDERS}} IN QUESTIONS (OPTIONAL)
  questions: [
    {
      id: 'q1',
      baseScenario: {
        timeMarker: "Day 1",
        dimension: "dimension_name",
        coreSetup: `{{fieldName}} does something...`
      },
      options: [...]
    }
  ],
  
  // 4. REST IS SAME AS BEFORE
  wordMatrix: { /* ... */ },
  aiExplanation: { /* ... */ }
}
```

## üöÄ What This Enables

### Before (Generic):
```
"You've been dating Jordan for 14 months..."
```
‚ùå Feels generic and disconnected

### After (Personalized):
```
User enters: Alex, 2+ years, living together
Result: "You've been dating Alex for 2+ years. You're living together..."
```
‚úÖ Feels personal and relevant!

---

## üìã The Flow

```
1. User clicks "Start Quiz"
   ‚Üì
2. Personalization Form appears
   - "What's your partner's name?" ‚Üí User enters "Sam"
   - "How long together?" ‚Üí User selects "1-2 years"
   - "Current situation?" ‚Üí User selects "Long distance"
   ‚Üì
3. Story Setup shows (personalized!)
   "You've been with Sam for 1-2 years. You're long distance..."
   ‚Üì
4. Q1 appears (base scenario)
   "Sam calls you..."
   ‚Üì
5. User answers Q1
   ‚Üì
6. AI adapts Q2 with:
   - Previous choice
   - Personalization data
   Result: "After you [Q1 choice], Sam texts..."
   ‚Üì
7. Continue through all questions (all personalized!)
   ‚Üì
8. Results analyze their journey with Sam specifically
```

## üéì Key Concepts

### 1. **Placeholders**
Use `{{fieldId}}` anywhere in text:
- Story setup premise
- Character names
- Question text (base scenarios)
- Automatically replaced with user input

### 2. **Base vs Adapted Text**
- **Base scenario**: What YOU write
- **Adapted text**: What AI generates for display
- **Saved for analysis**: Base scenario + user choice
- **Shown to user**: Adapted text (personalized + continuous)

### 3. **Personalization vs Adaptation**
- **Personalization**: User's context (names, timelines)
- **Adaptation**: Making scenes reference previous choices
- **Together**: Personalized + continuous story

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### Placeholder Naming:
- Use clear IDs: `partnerName`, `cityName`, `relationshipLength`
- Test in sentences: "{{partnerName}} asks you..." (reads well)
- Avoid: `p1`, `name`, `x` (unclear)

### Field Design:
- Keep forms short (3-5 fields max)
- Make defaults sensible (placeholders that work)
- Use select for standardized data
- Use text for names/custom content

### Story Integration:
- Use placeholders early in premise
- Reference them multiple times
- Test how different inputs read
- Make sure grammar works with all options
